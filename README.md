# python-practice

This repository is meant to storage some scripts I've written (in a pretty bad python honestly) as I learn more about this language.

I'll try to embbed in each script a small explanation about it, so it would be more comprehensible.

## Usage

If you wanna see these small attempts to programs working in your machine, just install Python:
- for Linux: come on, you know what you are doing
- for Windows: follow the [official webside's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
